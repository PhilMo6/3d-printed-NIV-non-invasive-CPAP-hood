Thread bag adapter into bag just enough to mark bag.
Use a soldering iron to melt the holes for the adapter. (Follow safe soldering practices and use a vent hood or do this outside)
Spread sealent/glue onto flange of the adapter and adapter ring.
Into the hole you made insert adapter into outside of bag then thread ring onto adapter from inside of bag, until tight.

Use male to male nylon fitting for oxygen adapter. Add small ammount of sealent/glue onto flange of fitting and insert into oxygen port on the adapter.
Place part thread side up to set to prevent any sealent/glue from leaking into oxygen port.

Once sealent/glue has set add teflon tape onto threads of other adapters and thread onto bag adapters when needed.
